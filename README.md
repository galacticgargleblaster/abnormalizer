# abnormalizer

## Installation

`tbd`

## Use

`abnormalizer [FILE]`

abnormalizer operates on `.c` and `.h` files only

## Will this break my program?

Maybe.  It's a program that edits your code so you don't have to.  It's far from perfect.  You are encouraged to draw your own conclusion.

### Why???

Respectably, 42 enforces a coding style for C.  However, it's woefully nonstandard.  Perhaps that's the point.  The enigmatic, under-funded 42 curriculum encourages students to fumble in the dark.  

`may not compile or is invalid for some reasons.` 

If we were grown-ups, we'd use clang-format for C/C++, or another language specific formatter such as gofmt, dartfmt, prettify
