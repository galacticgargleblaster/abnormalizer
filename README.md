# abnormalizer

## Installation

`tbd`

## Use

`abnormalizer [FILE]`

abnormalizer works* on `.c` and `.h` files only

## Will this break my program?

Maybe.  It's a program that edits your code so you don't have to.  It's far from perfect.  You are encouraged to draw your own conclusion.

### Why???

Respectably, 42 enforces a coding style for C.  Unfortunately it's woefully nonstandard

`may not compile or is invalid for some reasons.`
